# Python Trading Strategy Backtester for Non-Developers

Welcome! This guide will help you use a Python script (generated by an AI assistant like Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to test your trading strategies, even if you have no programming experience.

## How to Use This Guide

Follow these steps to get your strategy backtested:

### Step 1: Clearly Define Your Trading Strategy

Before you ask an AI to write code, you need to know *exactly* what your strategy involves. The more detail you provide to the AI, the better the script will be. Think about:

* **Strategy Name:** A simple name for your strategy.
* **Asset/Ticker Symbol:** What are you trading? (e.g., `AAPL` for Apple stock, `BTC-USD` for Bitcoin, `PETR4.SA` for Petrobras on B3).
* **Timeframe:** What chart timeframe? (e.g., `1d` for daily, `1h` for hourly, `15m` for 15-minute).
* **Date Range:** What period do you want to test? (e.g., Start: `2020-01-01`, End: `2023-12-31`).
* **Initial Capital:** How much virtual money to start with? (e.g., `10000` in the currency of the asset).
* **Position Sizing:** How much to invest per trade? Be specific (e.g., "100 shares", "fixed amount of 1000 currency units", "10% of current equity").
* **Entry Rules (Buy/Long):** Exactly what conditions must be met to enter a buy trade?
    * *Example: "Buy when the 14-period RSI crosses below 30 AND the 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) is above the 200-period SMA."*
* **Exit Rules (Sell/Close Long):** Exactly what conditions must be met to sell an existing long position?
    * *Example: "Sell when the 14-period RSI crosses above 70 OR if the price drops 2% below entry (Stop-Loss) OR if the price rises 4% above entry (Take-Profit)."*
* **Short Selling Rules (Optional):** If your strategy involves short selling (profiting from price drops), define clear entry and exit rules for short positions. If not, tell the AI "None".
* **Indicators:** List all indicators used and their settings (e.g., `RSI period: 14`, `SMA periods: 50 and 200`, `ATR period: 14`).
* **Stop-Loss:** How will you limit losses? (e.g., "2% below entry price for longs / 2% above entry for shorts", or "1.5 times the 14-period ATR value at the time of entry").
* **Take-Profit:** When will you take profits? (e.g., "4% above entry price for longs / 4% below entry for shorts", or "A Risk/Reward ratio of 1:2 based on your Stop-Loss distance").
* **Commissions (Optional):** Any trading fees? (e.g., "0.1% of trade value"). If not, assume zero.

### Step 2: Generate Your Python Script Using an AI Assistant

1.  Take the AI prompt provided (the big block of text in the previous section).
2.  Carefully fill in all the `[User will provide ...]` parts with your specific strategy details from Step 1.
3.  Copy the entire completed prompt and paste it into your conversation with an AI assistant (like Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).
4.  The AI will generate Python code. Once it's finished, copy the *entire* Python code block.
5.  Open a plain text editor:
    * **Windows:** Notepad (Search for "Notepad").
    * **macOS:** TextEdit (In TextEdit, go to `Format > Make Plain Text` before pasting).
    * **More Advanced (Optional):** VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.
6.  Paste the Python code into the editor.
7.  Save the file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `my_strategy_backtest.py`). Choose a sensible name and save it in a folder where you can easily find it.

### Step 3: Set Up Your Python Environment (One-Time Setup)

If you don't have Python installed, or haven't used it for this kind of task before, you'll need to do this first.

1.  **Install Python:**
    * Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * Download the latest stable version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
    * Run the installer. **Important for Windows users:** During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" or "Add python.exe to PATH".
2.  **Open a Terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell):**
    * **Windows:** Search for "cmd", "Command Prompt", or "PowerShell" in the Start menu.
    * **macOS:** Search for "Terminal" in Spotlight (Cmd+Space).
    * **Linux:** Usually Ctrl+Alt+T or search for "Terminal".
3.  **Install Required Libraries:**
    The Python script generated by the AI should list the libraries it needs at the top (usually `pandas`, `yfinance`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`). You install them using `pip`, Python's package installer. Type the following commands into your terminal, pressing Enter after each one:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    pip install yfinance
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    ```
    If the AI script mentions other libraries, install them similarly: `pip install library_name`. You only need to do this once per library.

### Step 4: Run the Backtesting Script

1.  **Navigate to Your Script's Folder:** In the terminal you opened, you need to go to the directory (folder) where you saved your `.py` file. Use the `cd` (change directory) command.
    * *Example (Windows):* If saved in `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\TradingScripts`, type:
        ```bash
        cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\TradingScripts
        ```
    * *Example (macOS/Linux):* If saved in `/Users/YourName/Documents/TradingScripts`, type:
        ```bash
        cd /Users/YourName/Documents/TradingScripts
        ```
    * *Tip for Windows:* In File Explorer, navigate to your folder, then type `cmd` or `powershell` in the address bar and press Enter. This will open a terminal directly in that folder.
2.  **Run the Script:** Once your terminal is in the correct folder, type `python` followed by the name of your script file, then press Enter.
    * *Example:*
        ```bash
        python my_strategy_backtest.py
        ```

### Step 5: Understand the Output

The script will run and should print the backtesting results directly in the terminal. This might include:

* Total Profit/Loss (and percentage)
* Number of Trades, Winners, Losers
* Win Rate
* Profit Factor
* Maximum Drawdown
* Sharpe Ratio
* Other metrics as requested.

If the script includes a plot and runs successfully, a new window might pop up showing a price chart with your buy and sell signals marked.

### Modifying Your Strategy

The AI should have placed your strategy parameters (ticker, dates, indicator settings, etc.) as variables near the top of the `.py` file. You can open the file with your text editor, change these values, save the file, and then re-run the script (Step 4) to test new variations.

### Important Notes & Disclaimer

* **Educational Purposes Only:** This tool is for learning and testing ideas. It is **NOT financial advice**.
* **Past Performance is Not Indicative of Future Results:** A profitable backtest does not guarantee your strategy will make money in live trading. Real markets have complexities like slippage (the price changing between when you decide to trade and when your trade actually executes), commissions/fees, and unexpected events that a simple script might not fully model.
* **Data Quality:** The accuracy of the backtest relies on the historical data from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`). While generally good for end-of-day data, intraday data can sometimes have gaps or inaccuracies.
* **Overfitting Risk:** Be very careful about tweaking your strategy too much just to make it look good on past data. This is called "overfitting," and it often leads to a strategy that performs poorly in real-time trading because it was too closely tailored to historical quirks.
* **Simplicity:** The generated script will likely be a simplified model. Real-world trading platforms have more sophisticated order execution and risk management.

### Basic Troubleshooting

* **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'some_library_name'`:**
    This means a required Python library is not installed. Go back to Step 3 and use `pip install some_library_name` in your terminal.
* **`SyntaxError` or other code errors (e.g., `NameError`, `TypeError`):**
    Sometimes AI-generated code can have small bugs.
    1.  Carefully copy the *entire error message* from the terminal.
    2.  Also, note which line of your Python script the error message points to.
    3.  Go back to your AI assistant, paste the error message and the relevant line(s) of code, and ask for help to fix it. Often, the AI can identify and correct its own mistakes.
* **Script doesn't run, or nothing happens:**
    * Double-check you are in the correct folder in the terminal (`cd` command).
    * Ensure you typed the Python command and filename correctly (e.g., `python your_script_name.py`).
    * Check for any typos in the script file itself, especially in the parameters you might have edited.

Good luck with testing your trading strategies!
